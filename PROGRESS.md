## 🐛 **Known Issues & Fixes**

### ✅ **FIXED: Real-time Subscription Issues** (2025-08-23)
**Problem**: Supabase real-time subscriptions were not working, causing:
- Host tab not updating to show guest players
- Game start getting stuck on "Starting..." 
- No real-time updates between players

**Root Cause**: Supabase real-time configuration issue - subscriptions were connecting but not receiving messages.

**Solution**: Implemented polling fallback system:
- Replaced real-time subscriptions with 2-second polling intervals
- Added fallback navigation for game start
- Maintained same user experience with reliable updates

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Game now works reliably with polling-based updates

### ✅ **FIXED: Game Loading Issues** (2025-08-23)
**Problem**: Game.tsx was failing to load with 406 errors and syntax issues:
- Duplicate export statements causing compilation errors
- Database query conflicts with multiple relationships
- Game not found errors when navigating from lobby

**Root Cause**: 
1. Syntax error: Duplicate `export default Game;` statements
2. Database query issue: Trying to select `rounds(*)` and `players(*)` in same query

**Solution**: 
1. Fixed duplicate exports in Game.tsx
2. Separated database queries to avoid relationship conflicts
3. Added better error handling and debugging logs
4. Improved game loading logic with separate queries

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Game loading works correctly, build successful

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Game Completion Logic** (2025-08-23)
**Features Added**:
- **Configurable game settings**: Target score and max rounds at game creation
- **Automatic game ending**: When target score is reached or max rounds completed
- **Manual game ending**: Host can end game early with "End Game" button
- **Final results screen**: Beautiful results page with winner, leaderboard, and stats
- **Game completion detection**: Automatic navigation to results when game ends

**Implementation**:
1. **Database updates**: Added target_score, max_rounds, current_round fields
2. **Game creation**: Added settings UI in Index.tsx
3. **Lobby display**: Shows game settings to all players
4. **Game component**: Added end game button for host, completion detection
5. **Results page**: Complete GameResults.tsx with winner announcement and stats

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full game completion system implemented

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Internationalization (i18n)** (2025-08-23)
**Features Added**:
- **Complete translation system**: English and Spanish language support
- **Language switcher**: Beautiful dropdown with flag icons in top-right corner
- **Comprehensive translations**: All UI text, errors, messages, and game content
- **Parameter interpolation**: Dynamic text with variables (e.g., "{player} reached {score}")
- **Persistent language selection**: Remembers user's language choice in localStorage
- **Fallback system**: Automatically falls back to English for missing translations

**Implementation**:
1. **Translation files**: Created `src/locales/en.ts` and `src/locales/es.ts` with 100+ translation keys
2. **i18n context**: Implemented `I18nContext` with language switching and translation functions
3. **Language switcher**: Created `LanguageSwitcher` component with globe icon and flag dropdown
4. **Component updates**: Updated all pages (Index, Lobby, Game, GameResults, Voting) to use translations
5. **Error messages**: All error messages and user feedback now support both languages

**Translation Coverage**:
- ✅ Landing page (create/join game)
- ✅ Game settings and configuration
- ✅ Lobby and player management
- ✅ Gameplay interface and categories
- ✅ Voting system and validation
- ✅ Results screen and statistics
- ✅ Error messages and notifications
- ✅ Common UI elements and actions

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full internationalization system implemented
